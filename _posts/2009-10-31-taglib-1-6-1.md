TagLib 1.6.1 has been released. It's a minor bug-fix release. Main changes are content-based detection of `.oga` files, saving Vorbis Comments to Ogg FLAC files and support for cover art in MP4 files. Tarball is available [here](http://launchpad.net/taglib/trunk/1.6.1/+download/taglib-1.6.1.tar.gz) for now, later also on [Scott's page](http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html), and updated API docs are [here](http://oxygene.sk/lukas/taglib/api/).

Detailed changelog:

  * Better detection of the audio codec of .oga files in FileRef.Â  ([Bug #178602](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=178602))
  * Fixed saving of Vorbis comments to Ogg FLAC files. TagLib tried to include the Vorbis framing bit, which is only correct for Ogg Vorbis. ([Max bug #445970](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maxosx/+bug/445970))
  * Public symbols now have explicitly set visibility to "default" on GCC.
  * Added missing exports for static ID3v1 functions.
  * Fixed a typo in taglib_c.pc
  * Fixed a failing test on ppc64.
  * Support for binary 'covr' atom in MP4 files. TagLib 1.6 treated them as text atoms, which corrupted them in some cases.
  * Fixed ID3v1-style genre to string conversion in MP4 files. ([Bug #198238](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198238))
