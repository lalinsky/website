Database Modeller 0.3 has been released. There isn't as many changes as I wanted, but the main changes were unreleased for almost half a year. You can download the source code and Windows installer on the [project page](http://oxygene.sk/lukas/projects/dbmodel/).

Changes since version 0.2:

  * PDF export
  * Support for printing
  * Opening of files passed through the command line arguments ([Bug #401595](https://bugs.launchpad.net/dbmodel/+bug/))
  * The recently used files list now always uses absolute paths
  * Implemented auto-scrolling in the diagram view ([Bug #420324](https://bugs.launchpad.net/dbmodel/+bug/420324))
  * The "Close" menu item will now only close the document, not the window ([Bug #420322](https://bugs.launchpad.net/dbmodel/+bug/420322))
  * Use the selected file format in the export dialog, instead of relying only on the extension ([Bug #396056](https://bugs.launchpad.net/dbmodel/+bug/396056))
