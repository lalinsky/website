[TagLib 1.6.3 was released](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.kde.devel.taglib/1493) this Monday, but somehow I forgot to post an update here. There isn't many changes, the main reason for the release were configuration issues with 1.6.2. The 1.6.3 tarball can be downloaded [here](http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/files/src/taglib-1.6.3.tar.gz) or [here](http://launchpad.net/taglib/trunk/1.6.3/+download/taglib-1.6.3.tar.gz).

Changes log:

  * Fixed definitions of the `TAGLIB_WITH_MP4` and `TAGLIB_WITH_ASF` macros.
  * Fixed upgrading of ID3v2.3 genre frame with ID3v1 code 0 (Blues).
  * New method `int String::toInt(bool *ok)` which can return whether the conversion to a number was successfull.
  * Fixed parsing of incorrectly written lengths in ID3v2 (affects mainly compressed frames). ([Bug #231075](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231075))
