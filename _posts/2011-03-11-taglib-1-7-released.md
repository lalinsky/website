TagLib 1.7 has been released. This release adds support for Monkeyâ€™s Audio files and cover art reading/writing for WMA and FLAC files. There is also a number of bug fixes, more details in the changelog. There are two important changes associated with this release:

  1. **Removed autoconf/automake support** -- If you used `./configure && make` to build TagLib, you will have to switch to the CMake-based build system. The [INSTALL](https://github.com/taglib/taglib/blob/master/INSTALL) file has been updated with instruction on how to build TagLib using CMake.
  2. **Source code moved to GitHub** -- TagLib's source code is now hosted in a Git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/taglib/taglib). The KDE SVN repository will stay available for some time, to not break anything, as the decision about the migration has been done very quickly, but it will not get any updates and will get removed in near future.
