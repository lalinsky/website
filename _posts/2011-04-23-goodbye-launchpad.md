All Acoustid components are now migrated to GitHub:

  * [Chromaprint](https://github.com/lalinsky/chromaprint)
  * [Acoustid Fingerprinter](https://github.com/lalinsky/acoustid-fingerprinter)
  * [Acoustid Server](https://github.com/lalinsky/acoustid-server)
  * [Acoustid Index](https://github.com/lalinsky/acoustid-index)
  * [Chromaprint plug-in for GStreamer](https://github.com/lalinsky/gst-chromaprint)

Even though I _still_ prefer the idea of Bazaar, the tools built around Git and especially GitHub make it worth switching for me. I started using Bazaar a long time ago because it was the only VCS that was able to work on Windows back then. I built several tools to make it more comfortable for me, but I get the feeling the situation is not improving. Maybe Git really is the VCS we should all use...
