A new version of the Acoustid fingerprinter has been released. It's contains just one small bug fix regarding [compatibility with Qt 4.8](https://github.com/lalinsky/acoustid-fingerprinter/issues/3). The official binaries for version 0.5 are not affected by this bug, so this is a source-only release.
