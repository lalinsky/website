A new version of the Acoustid fingerprinter has been released.
The main change is compatibility with the latest FFmpeg API and fix for a crash when
compiled with FFTW3.

The official binaries for version 0.5 are not affected by any of the changes in this version, so this is a source-only release.

Changes since version 0.5.1:
