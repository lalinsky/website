I was not very happy when GitHub announced that it [discontinues project downloads](https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads).
I was using GitHub to host compiled packages for Chromaprint and the AcoustID fingerprinter, as well as release tarballs for all
AcoustID projects, so I had to start looking for alternatives.

I could continue to use GitHub and host downloads elsewhere, but I like to have all project related files in a central location, 
so I've decided to move everything from GitHub to Bitbucket. You can now find all AcoustID source code and packages under
the [AcoustID account](https://bitbucket.org/acoustid) on Bitbucket.

I've not yet decided what to do with the GitHub repositories. They are still there for now,
but should be considered out of date and not used.
