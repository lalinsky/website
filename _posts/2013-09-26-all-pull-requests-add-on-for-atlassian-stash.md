Last few evenings I spend refreshing my Java skills and working on an add-on for
Atlasian Stash to display open pull requests from multiple repositories on a single place.

Stash is the obvious choice for code hosting for a company using other Atlassian products,
but it's still very much in the beginnings and doesn't do much except for providing users
access to Git repositories. It supports pull requests, but if you use multiple repositories,
they kind of get "lost" because there are no good overview pages.

This add-on adds two new pages, to view either all project-related pull requests or all
pull requests in the system, which makes it easy what's going on in the project.
