I bought a cheap Arduino nano clone from eBay and after I plugging it in via
USB, I was getting only errors when trying to upload some code. I realized
it came without the bootloader installed. And I didn't have a normal AVR ISP
programmer to program the flash memory on the microcontroller.

The ATmega328P chip can be programmed using the SPI protocol. The process
requires 4 digital wires and the Raspberry Pi with its GPIO pins
can be easily used to do that. On Linux, you can interact with GPIO pins
using a sysfs interface and avrdude (the application that can program the chip)
can talk the SPI protocol over this interface. So it's just a
matter of connecting the pieces together. Normally you would use
the AVR ISP pin header on Arduino to do this, but I did not have the
right connector for that, so I used regular pins and connect them on a
breadboard.

You need to use specific pins on the Arduino, but you can use
any of the available pins on the Raspberry Pi. I used these:

 * Pin D11 (MOSI) on Arduino to pin 20 on RPi
 * Pin D12 (MISO) on Arduino to pin 16 on RPi
 * Pin D13 (SCK) on Arduino to pin 21 on RPi
 * Pin RESET on Arduino to pin 12 on RPi
 * GND on Arduino to GND on RPi
 * Vin on Arduino to 5V on RPi

The result looked like this:

Now the software part. The avrdude package that comes with Raspbian is not
compiled with linuxgpio support, so we need to build our own.

    sudo apt-get install bison flex libusb-dev
    cd /tmp
    wget http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/avrdude/avrdude-6.1.tar.gz
    tar xf avrdude-6.1.tar.gz
    cd avrdude-6.1
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/avrdude --enable-linuxgpio
    make
    sudo make install

You need to edit `avrdude.conf` to let it know the pins used.

    sudo vim /opt/avrdude/etc/avrdude.conf

Somewhere in the file find the commented out `linuxgpio` section and add this in there.

    programmer
      id    = "linuxgpio";
      desc  = "Use the Linux sysfs interface to bitbang GPIO lines";
      type  = "linuxgpio";
      reset = 12;
      sck   = 21;
      mosi  = 20;
      miso  = 16;
    ;

If everything is connected and configured properly, you should be able to run this now and get into the avrdude console.

    sudo /opt/avrdude/bin/avrdude -p atmega328p -c linuxgpio -v -t

Now we need to modify the Arduino IDE configuration to recognize the new programmer. I don't know if this can be done locally, so we will edit the system-wide configuration file.

    sudo vim /usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/programmers.txt

Put this somewhere near the end of the file.

    rpigpio.name=RPi GPIO
    rpigpio.protocol=linuxgpio

We also need to tell the Arduino IDE to use our version of avrdude. Again, because I don't know of any better solution, we will overwrite the default symlinks that come with the package.

    sudo ln -fs /opt/avrdude/bin/avrdude /usr/share/arduino/hardware/tools/avrdude
    sudo ln -fs /opt/avrdude/etc/avrdude.conf /usr/share/arduino/hardware/tools/avrdude.conf

That was the last configuration step and now we can actually program the chip.
Becuse you can't use the Linux GPIO sysft interface as a regular user, you need to start the Arduino IDE as root for this.
Select your board type in "Tools -> Board", select the "RPi GPIO" option in "Tools -> Programmer" and then install the bootloader using "Tools -> Burn Bootloader".
Once the bootloader is installed you can close the IDE, remove the pin connections, plug in USB cable and start the IDE as a regular user.

Hope that helps somebody.
