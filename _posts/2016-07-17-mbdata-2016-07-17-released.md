I have released a new version of [mbdata](https://bitbucket.org/lalinsky/mbdata).
It's a small Python package for working with the MusicBrainz database using SQLAlchemy.

This version updates the SQLAlchemy models to the latest MusicBrainz database schema.
It also adds support for Python 3 in addition to Python 2.

Install:

    pip install mbdata==2016.7.17
