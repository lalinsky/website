Hi, my name is Lukáš Lalinský and I'm software developer from Slovakia who [loves music](http://www.last.fm/user/lukz), [hacking music/audio software](http://oxygene.sk/lukas/projects/) at home and [creating web applications](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lalinsky) at work. If you want to contact me for some reason, you can send me an email to [lalinsky@gmail.com](mailto:lalinsky@gmail.com).
