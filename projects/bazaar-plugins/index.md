I've written some plugins for the [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/) version control system:

  * [QBzr](http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/QBzr) -- Various GUI tools for Bazaar. I started this project, but I'm no longer involved in the develoment. It's now maintained by [Alexander Belchenko](https://launchpad.net/~bialix) and [Gary van der Merwe](https://launchpad.net/~garyvdm).
  * [extcommand](http://bzr.oxygene.sk/bzr-plugins/extcommand/) -- Configurable aliases for `bzr` that can invoke external shell commands.
  * [bookmarks](https://launchpad.net/bzr-bookmarks) -- Provides easy-to-remember aliases for remote locations that can by used in commands like `bzr pull` or `bzr push`.
  * [pager](https://launchpad.net/bzr-pager) -- Capture the output of Bazaar commands into a pager application (e.g. `less`).
  * [punchcard](https://launchpad.net/bzr-punchcard) -- Plugin for creating "punch card" graphs ([examples](http://oxygene.sk/lukas/2010/03/punchcard-graphs-for-bazaar/)).
