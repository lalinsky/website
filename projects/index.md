I like working on open source projects. Here is a few that I've either started or contributed a significant amount of work to. There is a more complete list on my [Ohloh page](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/luks).

  * [**Acoustid**](http://acoustid.org/) - Audio fingerprint database
  * [**Database Modeller**](/projects/dbmodel/) - Simple tool for drawing entity-relational diagrams
  * [**Bazaar plugins**](/projects/bazaar-plugins/) - Some plugins for the Bazaar version control system
  * [**TagLib**](http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html) - C++ library for reading/writing metadata in audio files
  * [**Picard**](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/PicardTagger) - MusicBrainz-based audio file tagger
  * Lots of other [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/) projects
